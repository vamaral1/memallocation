Java 7 and J-unit 4.0

Run `Driver.java` with an input file as the first and only program argument. Examples of input files are in the data folder. The format is as follows:

  1. The first line should be the number of units of memory available
  2. Every line following has the format: letter, space, number
    - The letter corresponds to a request to allocate (A) or de-allocate (D) a certain amount of memory
    - The number is corresponds to the amount of memory to perform the requested operation on
